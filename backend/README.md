## Technologies Utilized

The project leverages a versatile stack of technologies, enhancing its capabilities and functionality:

- **Go**: The primary programming language that powers the project's backend services.
- **Firebase**: Used for cloud services and authentication.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for flexible data storage.
- **Postgres**: A robust relational database for structured data.
- **gRPC**: A high-performance, language-agnostic remote procedure call framework.
- **REST**: Representational State Transfer, an architectural style for web services.

These technologies, combined, empower the project to deliver a robust and scalable solution.

## Getting Started

### Installation

- Clone this Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kananniftiyev/CloudShareX
```
- Move into project folder
```bash
cd YOUR_PROJECT_DIR
```

- Run **run_script.bat** file in **cmd** folder to start all services at the same time.
```bash
.\run_services.bat
```

### Configuration

Before you begin working on this project, it's important to perform some initial configuration to ensure a smooth setup.

### 1. Firebase Credentials

**Location:** `backend` folder

1. Place your Firebase credentials file in the `backend` folder.
2. Update the file path to your Firebase credentials in the `utils/firebase.go` file to ensure proper authentication and access to Firebase services.

### 2. Database Settings

In each service's respective database folder, make sure to configure the following settings:

- **Port**: Set the correct port for the database.
- **User**: Provide the username required for accessing the database.
- **Password**: Specify the password necessary for database access.

By adjusting these configuration parameters in the appropriate database folders for each service, you'll establish the correct database connectivity.

By following these configuration guidelines, you'll be well-prepared to initiate and run your project with all the necessary settings in place.
